Hi My name is Mandy, I am now working in Walmart Labs as front end software engineer, I have 1 year full time work experience and I am very proficient in different kinds of programming language and web framework such as redux and react

our team in Walmart belong to Catalog, our team response to develop interval content audit tool to help Walmart improve content audit work flow and help content audit progress more efficiency. 

Our team front end tec stack is JS use react redux base on electrode 

use this tool can directly upload production template and audit and quality check every detail and download it instead of manually audit use excel 

My work is according UX designer  mocks and Manger and PM requirements and use backend API implement different function which can display it in website , I also do some unit test and e2e automation

Why paypal,

First of all I think every one use PayPal, PayPal is very useful payment tool all over the world and I am very interested in this production

and Second I think pay-pal has many talent people, I really want to work with yours and contribute myself to company

I see this job is very suitable for me, because this job very much my teac and I really want to because full stack developer, want to development both front end and back end 

**The biggest mistake you make:**

most mistake : 2 hours before demo meeting to our manager and leaders, I find My response part has some problems and our team member told me she test it yesterday and it works, so I have't test it again by myself yesterday, I find some part does not work, and our team member for some reason cannot come. so I debug by myself and finally find out issue and solved. 

but I think I should test our code by myself whenever have changed and confirmed there no problems, take care about every things  

 **Most challenging project**

finished ete automation test by myself

I get this ticket in Dec and my leader want to me finished this for no more than one mon and a half.

actually I don't have any experience for automation test and I don't know how technology about automation test.

first of all, I learn some course in udamy and read some documents talk about this with my lead  and other automation team but another problems is that because for Holiday, most automation team are not been in office, when I use their automation test library and write automation test by myself, I meet some issue. No body can ask, so I search in internet and reference other team use same library code base, I solve almost by myself , I finish my ticket on time and final demo to manager, they think it is good

**Couldnâ€™t finish tasks before deadline?**

* **Try to finish all by working on some extra time.**
* **Still cannot finish will go through the plan again with product manager and possibly reschedule.**
* **Try to divide a each function into finer granularity and focus on the parts that users care about most or have highest priority.**
* **I joined the 2nd project as the main development isn't capable of delivering the expected result. The timeline left for me is so tight.**
* **In order to meet the milestones, I have to focus on building the main skeleton of the app and prove to the business team that this project is doable otherwise there might be a rick that they will cut the project.**
* **Finish a working demo with all barebone functions and did a good demo in order to save the project.**
