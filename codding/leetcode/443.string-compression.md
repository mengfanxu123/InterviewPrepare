# 443.String Compression

{% embed url="https://leetcode.com/problems/string-compression/" %}



Given an array of characters, compress it [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm).

The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array.

Every element of the array should be a **character** \(not int\) of length 1.

After you are done **modifying the input array** [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), return the new length of the array. 

**Follow up:**  
Could you solve it using only O\(1\) extra space? 

**Example 1:**

```text
Input:
["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]

Output:
Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

Explanation:
"aa" is replaced by "a2". "bb" is replaced by "b2". "ccc" is replaced by "c3".
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input:
["a"]

Output:
Return 1, and the first 1 characters of the input array should be: ["a"]

Explanation:
Nothing is replaced.
```

My method : use two pointer fast and slow, and a variable to save how more duplicate word in this array. do for loop use splice\(\) to remove the duplicate string and   insert number in this array

```javascript
const compression = (chars) => {
    let slow = 0;
    let fast = 0;
    let count = 0;
    while(slow < chars.length){
        if (chars[slow] === chars[fast]){
            count++;
            fast++;
            slow++
        }else if(count >= 2){
            const nums = count.toString();
            chars.splice(slow + 1, count - 1, ...nums)ï¼›
            fast = slow = slow + 2;
            count = 0;
        } else {
            fast = slow = slow + 1;
            count = 0;
        }
    } 
    return chars.length;
}
```
