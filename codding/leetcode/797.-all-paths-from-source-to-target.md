# 797. All Paths From Source to Target



Given a directed, acyclic graph of `N` nodes.  Find all possible paths from node `0` to node `N-1`, and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows:  the nodes are 0, 1, ..., graph.length - 1.  graph\[i\] is a list of all nodes j for which the edge \(i, j\) exists.

```text
Example:
Input: [[1,2], [3], [3], []] 
Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]] 
Explanation: The graph looks like this:
0--->1
|    |
v    v
2--->3
There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.
```

**Note:**

* The number of nodes in the graph will be in the range `[2, 15]`.
* You can print different paths in any order, but you should keep the order of nodes inside one path.

        dfs(graph, res, graph[index][i], cur);
        cur.pop();
